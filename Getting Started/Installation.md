# Installation

You need to install the latest Java and Eclipse for this class. Specifically, you need:

- [Java SE 8 JDK](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html)
- [Eclipse Mars for Java Developers](http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/eclipse-ide-java-developers/marsr)

See below for more detailed steps.

## Install Java JDK

You need to download the latest **Java Development Kit (JDK)** for **Java Standard Edition (SE) 8**. You can download the installer for your system at:

<http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html>

Follow the installation prompts. Install this first, *before* you try to install Eclipse.

*:warning: Do not download the Java Runtime Environment (JRE), which is included in the JDK, or the Enterprise Edition (EE) version.*

## Install Eclipse

You need to download the **Eclipse IDE for Java Developers** package from the latest latest **Eclipse Mars (4.5)** release. You can download the installer for your system at:

<http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/eclipse-ide-java-developers/marsr>

Extract the executable and place it with your other applications on your system. This version of Eclipse already has built-in support for Git.

*:warning: Do not download the Neon release, which is still in development, or the Eclipse IDE for Java EE Developers.*

## Install Github Client

*Optional:* You may also install **Github Desktop** for a simple interface for keeping your local and remote Github repositories synchronized. This is very useful if your repositories get mangled in Eclipse somehow.

<https://desktop.github.com/>

When installed, login with your Github account. However, I recommend you do *not* clone anything just yet, as we will do this within Eclipse.
