[» Click Here for Detailed Homework Submission Instructions «](https://github.com/cs212/homework)

## Required

Please work on the following in-class before leaving:

  1. You should already have the [`ArgumentParser`](https://github.com/cs212/homework/tree/fall2015/ArgumentParser) homework project created in Eclipse. If not, please do this before class. (You do not need to be passing all of the unit tests yet.) 

  2. Connect your `ArgumentParser` homework to your private homework repository on Github, and commit and push your code. We will walk through these steps during class. 
  
  3. Double-check your code is now visible by viewing your private homework repository at <https://github.com/cs212/> in Github. You will need to login to Github to view your repository.
  
  4. Log in to a lab computer [(steps here)](http://tutoringcenter.cs.usfca.edu/resources/logging-in-remotely.html), and run the `homework` test script [(steps here)](https://github.com/cs212/homework#homework-testing). 

The `homework` script should run successfully, but you do not need to be passing 100% of the unit tests until midnight. Do not hesitate to ask for help if you are uncertain how to pass a specific test.

## Optional

Repeat the above process for the new [`WordIndex`]() homework assignment, which is due next week. Make sure you can get the project setup in Eclipse with the template code, connect it successfully to Github, and successfully run the `homework` script (but not yet passing the unit tests). If you run into any issues, please ask for help!
