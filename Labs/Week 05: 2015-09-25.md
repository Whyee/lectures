# Lab Instructions

## Required

If you are not yet passing the Project 1 tests, please work on the following in-class:

1. Write code that returns a list of text files when given a directory. The [Files and Exceptions](https://github.com/cs212/lectures/tree/fall2015/Files%20and%20Exceptions) lectures may be useful. Test your code by calling it with the `input/index` directory included with your project and outputting the result to the console.

2. Create an inverted index data structure that is able to store words, paths, and locations. The [Data Structures](https://github.com/cs212/lectures/tree/fall2015/Data%20Structures) lectures and the [Word Index](https://github.com/cs212/homework/tree/fall2015/WordIndex) homework assignment may be helpful. Test your code by hard-coding the [output example](https://github.com/cs212/projects/blob/fall2015/projects/Project%201%20Inverted%20Index.md#output) provided in the project writeup, and outputting your data structure (unformatted) to the console.

Once you get to this point, continue working through the other [Project 1 Hints](https://github.com/cs212/projects/blob/fall2015/projects/Project%201%20Inverted%20Index.md#hints) provided in the writeup.

If you are passing the Project 1 tests, please complete the assigned quizzes. See the **Optional** section below for details.
