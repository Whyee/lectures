# Lab Instructions

## Required

The first thing you should do in lab is signup for a Github account:

1. Sign up for a [GitHub](https://github.com/join) account using your official `@usfca.edu` email address. Use a professional name!

2. While you are at it, request a free [Student Developer Pack](https://education.github.com/pack) for free private Github repositories and more. *(Optional)*

When that is complete, complete the following in-class before leaving:

1. Log into [Canvas](https://usfca.instructure.com/courses/1553675) using your myUSF account.

2. Click "Piazza" on the navigation bar in Canvas. Follow the prompts to enroll.

3. In Piazza, find the [Piazza Confirmation](https://piazza.com/class/idp68bejrhd68n?cid=7) poll and vote. You will receive credit for this in Canvas later.

4. Click "Quizzes" on the navigation bar in Canvas. Fill out the [Background Survey](https://usfca.instructure.com/courses/1553675/quizzes/2292151) and [Github Account](https://usfca.instructure.com/courses/1553675/quizzes/2292144) surveys.

## Optional

You should use the rest of lab time to get started on the first homework. Use this as an opportunity to setup your Eclipse environment with the instructor and TA present to help out.

For how to install the latest version of Java and Eclipse, see the [Getting Started](../Getting Started/) guide. Then, follow these steps:

1. Create an "ArgumentParser" project in Eclipse. Double-check your spelling, capitalization, and make sure there are no spaces.

2. Download the [ArgumentParser](https://github.com/cs212/homework/tree/fall2015/ArgumentParser) template and test code from Github. This was demonstrated in-class. If you need help, do not hesitate to flag down the instructor or TA!

3. Open the `ArugmentParserTest.java` file in Eclipse and hover your mouse over one of the `@Test` annotations. Follow the prompts to add JUnit 4 to the build pass.

   :warning: Make sure you add JUnit 4, and **not** JUnit 3!
  
4. Make sure you can run both the `ArgumentParser.java` and `ArgumentParserTest.java` files successfully in Eclipse.

5. Start working on **one test at a time** to build up your functionality. Focus on the *first* test in the file that fails and ignore the rest!

:warning: Do not worry about connecting your homework to a Github repository yet. I need your account names first to setup everything, so we will cover how to do this in-class next week.

## Deadlines

:warning: Deadlines are kept updated in Canvas. Double-check all deadlines there for any changes!
