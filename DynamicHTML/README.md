## Relevant Resources ##

To add Jetty as a third-party library in Eclipse, you will need the aggregate `jar` files located at the following links:

- [`jetty-all-9.x.x.jar`](http://central.maven.org/maven2/org/eclipse/jetty/aggregate/jetty-all/)
- [`javax.servlet-3.x.x.jar`](http://central.maven.org/maven2/javax/servlet/javax.servlet-api/)

Replace each `x` with the latest stable version numbers. For help with embedded Jetty, see:

- [Jetty Development Guide - Embedding](http://www.eclipse.org/jetty/documentation/current/advanced-embedding.html)
