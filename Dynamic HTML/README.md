## Relevant Resources ##

To add Jetty as a third-party library in Eclipse, you will need the aggregate `jar` files located at the following links:

- [`jetty-all-9.x.x.jar`](http://repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/eclipse/jetty/aggregate/jetty-all/)
- [`javax.servlet-3.x.x.jar`](http://repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/eclipse/jetty/orbit/javax.servlet/)

Replace each `x` with the latest stable version numbers.
